- Each implicant is a **product** term of the function

- implicants (蕴含项)

  - **Prime Implicants**: a group that covers the maximum possible number of adjacent squares.![Screen Shot 2022-10-12 at 09.08.10](img/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-12%20at%2009.08.10.png)

  - **Essential Prime Implicants**: a prime implicant that ==covers a minterm== which is not covered by any other prime implicants![Screen Shot 2022-10-12 at 09.07.28](img/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-12%20at%2009.07.28.png)

#### Odd and Even Functions

- In general, for an n-variable Odd Function, the function is 1 if there are odd number of variables having logic 1

​	e.g. **XOR**

- For an n-variable Even Function, the function is 1 if there are even number of variables having logic 1

​	e.g. **XNOR**
